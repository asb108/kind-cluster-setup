## Breaking Changes

### Partial Prerendering (PPR)

The experimental PPR feature in Next.js 15.3 has been disabled due to compatibility issues. If you want to enable this feature in the future, you'll need to update the `next.config.mjs` file and ensure your code is compatible with PPR.

### React 18.3 Features

React 18.3 introduces some new features and changes that might affect your code:

- Improved error handling with better error messages
- Enhanced concurrent rendering capabilities
- Changes to the way effects are handled

### CSS Module Changes

Next.js 15.3 has changes in how CSS modules are handled. We've added fixes to ensure styles load correctly, but you might encounter styling issues in some edge cases. If you notice any styling problems, try the following:

1. Clear your browser cache
2. Restart the development server
3. Check for any CSS module naming conflicts

## Testing

After the upgrade, make sure to thoroughly test the application to ensure everything works as expected. Pay special attention to:

- Navigation between pages
- Form submissions
- API interactions
- UI animations and transitions
- Error handling

## Future Considerations

- Consider enabling PPR once compatibility issues are resolved
- Explore new React 18.3 features for performance improvements
- Evaluate the need for additional UI component library updates
